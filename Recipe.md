Mix chicken with 1 tsp salt and vinegar and keep aside for ½ an hour.

In a pan, heat 2 tbsp oil.

When the oil is hot, add 2 sprigs of curry leaves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, poppy seeds, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, black peppercorns, and 8 – 10 dry red chilies. If you have Gundu Chillies, use them. I used Kashmiri Red Chillies. If Kalpasi is available to use, use a big pinch at this stage.

Fry till slightly browned and a nice aroma starts coming. Add ½ cup of chopped onion and grated coconut and fry for 3-4 minutes.

Add ginger-garlic paste and fry for another 3-4 minutes.

Cool and grind the mixture in a grinder. Add water to grind the ingredients.

Smooth paste made ☺
(Now keep that aside)

Add 3 tbsp oil in a pan.

Add 2-3 sprigs of curry leaves and remaining onion. Use Indian shallots in place of onions if they are available to you.

Fry till onion is golden brown. Add green chili, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.

Add tomato and the roasted and ground mixture.

Now add a cup of water and cook for a minute.

Add chicken and another cup of water and cover and cook till chicken is done.

Add lime juice and fresh coriander and cook for a minute.

Serve hot with Naan and enjoy !! ☺

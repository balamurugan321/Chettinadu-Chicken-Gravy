Chicken
The key ingredient here is Chicken.I used full chicken cut into pieces but you can use only legs or legs with thighs. It is marinated with vinegar and salt and kept aside for some time. If you are not a fan of bone-in chicken, you can use boneless chicken too.

Chettinad Masala
The ingredient that makes the onion tomato base of this dish different from others is the freshly grounded Chettinad masala, and fresh coconut. While the Chettinad masala gives it a hot and spicy flavor, fresh coconut adds a refreshing taste to it.
To make an authentic Chettinad Masala, you need 3 main ingredients, Gundu Chilies, Kalpasi (Stone Flower) and Indian shallots.

The other ingredients needed to make the masala are curry leaves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, poppy seeds, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and black peppercorn.

Coriander Leaves and Lime
End this chicken curry with these two ingredients, to add more freshness and taste to the curry.

Others
Apart from this you will need curry leaves, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, and some basic spice powders such as turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.
